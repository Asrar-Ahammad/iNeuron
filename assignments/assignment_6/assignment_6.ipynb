    "# Q3. The standards and conventions followed for better readiblity are:\n",
    "**Ans)**\n",
    "1. **Use descriptive names:** Choose variable names that are descriptive and convey the purpose or meaning of the variable. This helps in understanding the code without needing additional comments. For example, use total_students instead of ts or num.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use lowercase with underscores:** Variable names should be in lowercase, and words should be separated by underscores (_). This convention is known as `snake_case`. For example, `user_name`, `num_of_students`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use of comments:** Comments can be used to explain code in a better way which helps to understand it better. Comment in single line are written as ` # Comment`. Multi line comments are written as `/* comment */`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid abbreviations or acronyms:** Unless widely accepted or commonly used, avoid abbreviations or acronyms in variable names. Use descriptive names instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Be consistent and meaningful:** Use consistent naming conventions throughout your codebase. If you have variables related to the same concept, use consistent prefixes or suffixes. For example, first_name and last_name for a person's name."

    "**1. Escape sequences:** The backslash is used to introduce escape sequences within strings. Escape sequences represent special characters and have a specific meaning. Some commonly used escape sequences include:<br>\n",
    "`\\\\` represents a literal backslash.<br>\n",
    "`\\'` represents a single quotation mark within a string.<br>\n",
    "`\\\"` represents a double quotation mark within a string.<br>\n",
