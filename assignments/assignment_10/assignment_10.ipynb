    "## 1. What is the role of try and exception block?\n",
    "The role of the try-except block in Python is to handle and manage exceptions that may occur during the execution of a block of code. It allows you to anticipate and gracefully handle potential errors or exceptional situations, preventing the program from abruptly terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try-except block works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code that might raise an exception is enclosed within the try block.\n",
    "2. If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution of the try block is immediately halted.\n",
    "3. The program flow jumps to the corresponding except block that can handle the specific type of exception that occurred.\n",
    "4. The except block contains code to handle the exception. It can provide appropriate error messages, perform necessary cleanup operations, or take any other action required to handle the exceptional situation.\n",
    "5. Once the except block is executed, the program continues to run from the point immediately after the try-except block."

    "## 3. What happens if an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block?\n",
    "Ans) If an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block to handle that specific exception type, the exception will propagate to the surrounding higher-level try-except blocks to see if any of them can handle the exception. If no matching except block is found in any of the higher-level try-except blocks, the exception will continue to propagate further until it reaches the top-level of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the exception reaches the top-level without being caught and handled, the program will terminate and display an error message (known as an unhandled exception). The error message typically includes information about the type of exception, the line number where the exception occurred, and a traceback showing the sequence of function calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to have appropriate exception handling in place to catch and handle exceptions effectively, especially for exceptions that are expected or known to occur in your code. This helps prevent the program from crashing and allows for graceful handling of errors and exceptional situations."

    "## 4. What is the difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type?\n",
    "Ans) The difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type lies in the scope of exceptions that are caught and handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bare Except Block:**\n",
    "A bare except block, also known as a generic except block, is written as except: without specifying any particular exception type. It catches and handles all types of exceptions that may occur in the corresponding try block. It acts as a catch-all for any exception that is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "* It provides a way to catch and handle unexpected exceptions.\n",
    "* It prevents the program from crashing if an unknown exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "* It can make it difficult to identify the specific type of exception that occurred, making debugging more challenging.\n",
    "* It may inadvertently catch and handle exceptions that should be allowed to propagate and be handled elsewhere.\n",
    "* It can mask programming errors by silently handling exceptions that should have been explicitly addressed.\n",

    "**Specific Exception Type:**\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* It provides a focused approach to handle specific exceptions that are expected or known.\n",
    "* It allows for more precise and targeted exception handling.\n",
    "* It makes the code more readable and explicitly states the expected exception types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* If a different exception occurs than the one specified in the except block, it will not be caught and will propagate to the higher-level try-except blocks or terminate the program if not handled.\n",

It typically occurs when there are issues with indentation formatting, such as using tabs and spaces inconsistently within the same block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "g. ValueError: This error is raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an invalid value. It typically occurs when a function or operation expects a specific value range or format, and the provided value does not meet the requirements or is not valid for the operation being performed."
