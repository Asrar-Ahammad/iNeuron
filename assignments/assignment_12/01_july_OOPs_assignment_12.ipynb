    "# 1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "Ans) The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model the real world in a programming paradigm by organizing data and code into self-contained units called \"objects.\" OOP aims to bring together data (attributes) and the operations (methods or functions) that can be performed on that data within these objects. This approach is intended to make software development more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main principles of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object). This way, the internal details and implementation of an object are hidden from the outside, and only the necessary interfaces (public methods) are exposed for interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows developers to create simplified models of complex systems and ignore irrelevant complexities, making the code more manageable and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of their parent classes. It promotes code reusability and supports the \"is-a\" relationship, where a derived class is a specialized version of its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent multiple types of objects and ensures that the correct method is called based on the actual type of the object at runtime. This feature fosters flexibility and extensibility in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing these principles, OOP helps developers write modular, maintainable, and scalable code, making it easier to build and manage complex software systems. OOP is widely used in various programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and many more to build robust and efficient applications."

    "Ans) An object is a fundamental unit that represents a particular instance of a class. It is a self-contained entity that encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) associated with that specific instance. Objects are created from classes, which act as blueprints or templates defining the structure and behavior of the objects."
