    "Ans) Built-in functions are the functions that are pre defined in python which can be directly called without decleration. User defined are the function that need to be declared before using them. User defined funtions are the functions that can be customized according to the need of the user."

    "## 3. What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return statements? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans) The return statement in a function is used to specify the value that the function should output or \"return\" to the caller. It allows a function to compute a value and provide it back to the part of the code that called the function.\n",
    "\n",

    "A function can indeed have multiple return statements. The execution of a function can take different paths based on conditions or logic within the function, and each path may produce a different value to be returned.\n",

    "## 4. What are lambda functions in Python? How are they different from regular functions? Provide an example where a lambda function can be useful.\n",
    "Ans) Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a way to define and use small, one-line functions without the need for a formal function definition. They are typically used in situations where a small function is required, and defining a named function would be unnecessary or cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key characteristics and differences between `lambda` functions and regular functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:** Lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by a list of parameters, a colon `(:)`, and an expression. The result of the expression is automatically returned as the output of the lambda function. In contrast, regular functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, a colon `(:)`, and a block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nameless Functions:** Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a formal name associated with them. They are created and used inline, typically as part of a larger expression or function call. Regular functions, on the other hand, have a name assigned to them, allowing them to be reused and referenced elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Size:** Lambda functions are often concise and limited to a single expression. They are not designed for complex logic or multiple statements. In contrast, regular functions can have multiple statements, control flow structures, and more complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Type:** Lambda functions create function objects, just like regular functions. However, due to their anonymous nature, lambda functions are usually used as function objects that are immediately invoked or passed as arguments to higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5. How does the concept of \"scope\" apply to functions in Python? Explain the difference between local scope and global scope.\n",
    "Ans) In Python, the concept of \"scope\" refers to the region or context in which a variable, function, or object is defined and can be accessed. Scopes determine the visibility and lifetime of variables, meaning where they can be referenced and how long they exist in memory.\n",
    "1. Local Scope:\n",
